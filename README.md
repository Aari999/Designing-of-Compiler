Compiler Design Project
Overview
This project is a simple compiler designed for educational purposes. 
It includes a lexer and parser written in C++, demonstrating the fundamental concepts of compiler design. 
The lexer tokenizes input source code, and the parser processes the tokens to perform basic arithmetic operations and variable assignments.

Features
Lexical analysis with a simple lexer
Basic arithmetic operations
Variable declaration and assignment
Error handling for invalid expressions and variable usage

Getting Started
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio)
Git (for version control)

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Aari999/Designing-of-Compiler.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Compiler_Design_Project

Compile the source code:
g++ main.cpp -o compiler
Note: Adjust the compilation command based on your C++ compiler.

Usage
Run the compiled executable:
./compiler input_file.txt
Replace input_file.txt with the path to your input source code file.

View the output of the compiler.
